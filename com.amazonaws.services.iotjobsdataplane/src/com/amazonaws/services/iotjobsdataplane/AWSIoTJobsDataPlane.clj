  "Interface for accessing AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane.

  Note: Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
  AbstractAWSIoTJobsDataPlane instead.



  AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to and executed
  on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to
  download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
  operations.


  To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be performed, and you
  specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or
  both.


  AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the execution of the
  job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT.
  The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the targets of the
  job"
