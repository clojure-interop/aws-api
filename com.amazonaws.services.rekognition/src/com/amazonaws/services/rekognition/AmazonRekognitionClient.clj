(defn index-faces
  "Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.


   Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm
   first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature
   vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face
   match and search operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations.


   For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.


   To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.


   If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in
   the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.


   If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the
   OrientationCorrection field.


   To determine which version of the model you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection
   ID. You can also get the model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from
   IndexFaces


   For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.


   If you provide the optional ExternalImageID for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition
   associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response
   returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces
   with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.


   You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the MaxFaces input parameter. This is
   useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those
   belonging to people standing in the background.


   The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that donâ€™t meet the
   required quality bar chosen by Amazon Rekognition. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By
   default, IndexFaces filters detected faces. You can also explicitly filter detected faces by
   specifying AUTO for the value of QualityFilter. If you do not want to filter detected
   faces, specify NONE.



   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model. To get the version
   of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.



   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace
   objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:




   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter.




   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.




   The face is too blurry.




   The image is too dark.




   The face has an extreme pose.




   In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces,
   FaceRecords. This includes:




   The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.




   A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a
   face.




   A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.




   An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image.




   If you request all facial attributes (by using the detectionAttributes parameter), Amazon
   Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth)
   and other facial attributes like gender. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the
   same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face
   metadata.



   The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3
   bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The
   image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

   image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.


   In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For
   each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role,
   and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the
   bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the
   faces match.



   By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You
   can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.



   CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it
   returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns

   mouth), gender, presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on.


   The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm
   might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence.

   S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg
   formatted file.


   The DetectText operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements,
   TextDetections. Each TextDetection element provides information about a single word or
   line of text that was detected in the image.


   A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. DetectText
   can detect up to 50 words in an image.


   A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's
   license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when
   there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between
   words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't
   represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns
   multiple lines.


   To determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the
   TextDetection object Type field.

   For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.



   DetectLabels does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported
   for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer
   Guide.



   You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If
   you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must
   be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.


   For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and
   the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a
   lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.


   {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}


   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}


    {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}


   In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also
   return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for
   example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.


   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}


   {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}


   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}


   In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.


   In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation
   correction. Optionally, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the
   labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to limit the number of
   labels returned.



   If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the
   DetectFaces operation provides.



   DetectLabels returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of
   Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, for the location
   of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.


   DetectLabels also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car
   might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent)
   and Transportation (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each
   ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and
   Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.


   This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.
