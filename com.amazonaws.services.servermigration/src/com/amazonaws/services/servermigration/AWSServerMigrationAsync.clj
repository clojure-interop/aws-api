  "Interface for accessing SMS asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object representing
  the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an AsyncHandler can be used to receive notification when
  an asynchronous operation completes.

  Note: Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
  AbstractAWSServerMigrationAsync instead.


  AAWS Sever Migration Service

  This is the AWS Sever Migration Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
  for each of the actions and data types for the AWS Sever Migration Service (AWS SMS). The topic for each action shows
  the Query API request parameters and the XML response. You can also view the XML request elements in the WSDL.


  Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or
  platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs.


  To learn more about the Server Migration Service, see the following resources:
