   as ByteMatchSets and IPSets) in a Rule, AWS WAF immediately takes the
   corresponding action, allow or block, and doesn't evaluate the request against the remaining Rules
   in the WebACL, if any.




   To create and configure a WebACL, perform the following steps:




   Create and update the predicates that you want to include in Rules. For more information, see
   CreateByteMatchSet, UpdateByteMatchSet, CreateIPSet, UpdateIPSet,
   CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet, and UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet.




   Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL. For more
   information, see CreateRule and UpdateRule.




   Create a WebACL. See CreateWebACL.




   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken
   parameter of an UpdateWebACL request.




   Submit an UpdateWebACL request to specify the Rules that you want to include in the
   WebACL, to specify the default action, and to associate the WebACL with a CloudFront
   distribution.


   The ActivatedRule can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your
   ActivatedRule, you can exclude specific rules from that rule group.


   If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an UpdateWebACL
   request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the
   re-insert it again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules.




   Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the rule type when first creating
   the rule, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default
   rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist.

   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44




   You then add the Rule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that

   Each Predicate object identifies a predicate, such as a ByteMatchSet or an IPSet, that

   requests every five minutes that triggers the rule.


   If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request must match all the predicates and
   exceed the RateLimit to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a
   RateBasedRule:




   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32




   A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header




   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 15,000.


   You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests
   that satisfy the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the
   User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that
   match these two conditions much be received at a rate of more than 15,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops
   below this limit, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.


   As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could
   add the following to a RateBasedRule:




   A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI




   A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH




   A TargetString of login

   or the length of the query string. For example, you can create a SizeConstraintSet that matches any
   requests that have a query string that is longer than 100 bytes. You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those
   requests.


   To create and configure a SizeConstraintSet, perform the following steps:




   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a
   CreateSizeConstraintSet request.




   Submit a CreateSizeConstraintSet request.




   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken
   parameter of an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request.




   Submit an UpdateSizeConstraintSet request to specify the part of the request that you want AWS WAF to
   inspect (for example, the header or the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.




   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

(defn create-web-acl

   Create and update the ByteMatchSet objects and other predicates that you want to include in
   Rules. For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet, UpdateByteMatchSet,
   CreateIPSet, UpdateIPSet, CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet, and UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet.

(defn create-rate-based-rule
  "Creates a RateBasedRule. The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit, which specifies
   the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The
   RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and
   other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the
   RateLimit.


   If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the
   RateLimit, but it also must match all the specifications to be counted or blocked. For example,
   suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:




   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32




   A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header




   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 15,000.


   You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests
   that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44
   and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further,
   requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 15,000 requests every five
   minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops
   below 15,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.


   As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could
   add the following to a RateBasedRule:




   A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI




   A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH




   A TargetString of login




   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 15,000.


   By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL, you could limit requests to your login page
   without affecting the rest of your site.


   To create and configure a RateBasedRule, perform the following steps:




   Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see
   CreateByteMatchSet, CreateIPSet, and CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet.




   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of a
   CreateRule request.




   Submit a CreateRateBasedRule request.




   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken
   parameter of an UpdateRule request.




   Submit an UpdateRateBasedRule request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the
   rule.




   Create and update a WebACL that contains the RateBasedRule. For more information, see
   CreateWebACL.
