  "Client for accessing Pinpoint Email asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
  representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an AsyncHandler can be used to receive
  notification when an asynchronous operation completes.

  Amazon Pinpoint Email Service

  This document contains reference information for the Amazon Pinpoint
  Email API, version 1.0. This document is best used in conjunction with the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide.


  The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these
  Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Regions and Endpoints in the
  Amazon Web Services General Reference.


  In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each
  other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
  Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing
  latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure."
