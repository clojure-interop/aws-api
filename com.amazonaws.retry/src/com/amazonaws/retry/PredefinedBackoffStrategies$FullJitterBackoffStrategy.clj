  original-request - The original request object being executed. For performance reason, this object is not a defensive copy, and caller should not attempt to modify its data. - `com.amazonaws.AmazonWebServiceRequest`
  exception - The exception from the failed request, represented as an AmazonClientException object. There are two types of exception that will be passed to this method: AmazonServiceException (sub-class of AmazonClientException) indicating a service error AmazonClientException caused by an IOException when executing the HTTP request. Any other exceptions are regarded as unexpected failures and are thrown immediately without any retry.
